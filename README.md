# Overview of the Project

This project was made using Reactjs.
The project is inspired by [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/c/JamesQQuick) one of the video's where he explains about the different ways of debugging the code in Javascript.

The project is (as name suggests) a random password generator, where the user have a slider to slide till the required length, they want for their password and check the checkboxes of the characters/symbols they want in their password.

The user then can copy that password to the clipboard and use it.
